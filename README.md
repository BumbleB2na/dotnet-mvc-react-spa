## Project History

1. Used Visual Studio to create new ASP.NET Core 3.1 project, "DotNetMVC" using React.js project template with no authentication.
1. Manually added in MVC components since not beginning with ASP.NET Core Web Application (Model-View-Controller) project template.
1. Built Api Controllers in .Net and separated data access in to a repository.
1. Built React frontend with its components to isolate frontend code and services to handle api access.
